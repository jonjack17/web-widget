Use fetch() to work with the API

Use async/await with fetch()


One idea: getting the whole response data, so that I get the keys. Then using 
the "get user" button to call the api for each ID in turn, until it gets to the 
end.


I have the array of responseId's. So I can call the api for each Id in that array.
I want that to happen everytime I click the "get user "button.  So the "get user" 
button should call the functions that create/render the user object.




Todo:

Secure all urls in environmemt file

Add try/catch on all API calls (including for the purpose of displaying error
when server is not up) - Done!

Do addtopage section - pretty much done

**When a new user is added, getting all the data again so that "get user" button
displays all data, including data just added (without having to refresh) - done

Styling fixes/improvements - done, and fruit is good, but maybe some tiny 
finishing touches there. (editing list style etc)

Refactoring as needed
