Use fetch() to work with the API

Use async/await with fetch()


One idea: getting the whole response data, so that I get the keys. Then using 
the "get user" button to call the api for each ID in turn, until it gets to the 
end.


I have the array of responseId's. So I can call the api for each Id in that array.
I want that to happen everytime I click the "get user "button.  So the "get user" 
button should call the functions that create/render the user object.
